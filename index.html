  <p style="font-size=20px"><b>ALPA (Anti Logic Paranormal Activity) is an experimental, 
   non-commercial project from the Russian developer RG'ee (replenishments are possible). 
   In fact, the story of its creation is a rather realistic dream about unrealistic things, 
   a lot of time that has nowhere to go and the desire to create a game in the style of a visual 
   novel or something like that. Perhaps the product itself will consist of a set of arcades, 
   slashers, shooters, puzzles and simulators, or it may be completely canceled. That's all, 
   and by the way, people who know about the project: 4.</b></p>
